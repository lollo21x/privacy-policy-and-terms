      <h2>Privacy Policy (single policy for Will, Will Pro, nextwiki)</h2>
      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 08/09/2025</p>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Doot Inc.</strong> (the “Company”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal data in connection with the services <em>"Will</em>, <em>Will Pro</em>, and <em>nextwiki</em> (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

      <h3>2. Data we collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication & account data (required):</strong> Email address obtained via Google Sign-In (<code>openid</code>, <code>email</code> scope).</li>
        <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> Full name and profile picture from Google (<code>profile</code> scope).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage & technical data:</strong> IP address, device and browser information, access logs, and error reports.</li>
        <li><strong>User content:</strong> Text prompts, uploaded images and files, and chat messages you submit to the Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies & similar technologies:</strong> session cookies and analytics cookies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Key statement on prompt data and model training (important)</h3>
      <p><strong>We do not use user prompts or uploaded content to train or improve our internal models or for analytics.</strong><br>
      Prompts and content are forwarded to third-party AI providers (e.g., OpenRouter) only as necessary to generate responses. If forwarded, those third parties’ data handling practices apply to the forwarded data. We do not independently reuse prompt content for training unless explicitly stated and consented.</p>

      <h3>4. Purpose and legal basis for processing</h3>
      <p>We process data to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide authentication and account management (legal basis: performance of a contract / user consent).</li>
        <li>Deliver the Services (generate AI responses, store user content) (legal basis: performance of a contract).</li>
        <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse and comply with legal obligations (legal basis: legitimate interest / legal obligation).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Third parties and data transfers</h3>
      <p>We rely on third-party providers, including: Google (authentication), OpenRouter (AI model hosting), Pexels API (images for nextwiki), hosting and analytics providers. Forwarding of prompts to OpenRouter and other model hosts is necessary for model responses. These providers may be located outside the EU; transfers are governed by contractual safeguards.</p>

      <h3>6. Data retention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Account data: retained while the account is active or until deletion request.</li>
        <li>User content (chats, uploads): retained by default for <strong>12 months</strong> unless you request earlier deletion.</li>
        <li>Logs and diagnostics: retained up to <strong>24 months</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Contact <code>privacy@dootinc.dpdns.org</code> to request deletion or a different retention schedule.</p>

      <h3>7. User rights (EU/EEA)</h3>
      <p>You have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict processing, portability, and to object. To exercise rights, contact <code>privacy@dootinc.dpdns.org</code>. You may also revoke Google access via your Google account settings.</p>

      <h3>8. Google OAuth use and required scopes</h3>
      <p>We use Google Sign-In for authentication. Requested scopes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>openid</code>, <code>email</code> (required) — to identify account and email.</li>
        <li><code>profile</code> to obtain full name and profile photo if you choose to share them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> request additional Google scopes (Drive, Calendar, Contacts, etc.). If you do not wish to share your name/photo, you can still sign in using only <code>email</code>.</p>

      <h3>9. AI content disclaimer</h3>
      <p>AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased. Such content is provided “as-is” and is not professional advice. You are responsible for verifying AI outputs before relying on them.</p>

      <h3>10. Pexels images (nextwiki)</h3>
      <p>nextwiki displays images from Pexels via the official Pexels API. Use of Pexels images is subject to Pexels’ license and terms; consult Pexels for commercial reuse questions.</p>

      <h3>11. Security</h3>
      <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, but no system is absolute. In case of a personal data breach we will follow applicable notification rules.</p>

      <h3>12. Changes to this Policy</h3>
      <p>We will update this Policy as needed; we will post the revised effective date. Material changes will be notified.</p>
